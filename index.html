<h1>Design Toward the Future of Learning for ALL</h1>

  <span>I am a second-year doctoral student in the Department of </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://education.purdue.edu/graduate-students/prospective-students/graduate-programs/learning-design-technology/">Learning Design and Technology at Purdue University</a></span><span>, co-advised by </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xSX2cwkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Victoria Lynn Lowell (Walker)</a></span><span> and </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=f8J04qAAAAAJ">Dr. Marisa Exter</a></span><span>. I research, integrate, and design instructional methods and technologies including web applications, artificial intelligence, and mixed reality to enhance learners' learning experience in blended and online learning environments. I designed and developed a mobile application, </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tic-app/id6443509306">TIC APP</a></span><span>, available for download on the App Store.

  <span>I earned my master’s degree in </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://education.indiana.edu/programs/instructional-systems-technology.html">Instructional Systems Technology, Indiana University Bloomington</a></span><span>, advised by </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dsdG3ewAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Curtis J. Bonk</a></span><span>. After graduation, I worked as the product manager at </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://www.hilink.co/">HiLink</a></span><span> in Chicago, as an Instructional &amp; Research Manager in the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://cyberlab.iupui.edu">Cyber Lab</a></span><span> at IUPUI for a year, and as visiting faculty in the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://chinese.indiana.edu/index.html">Chinese flagship program at Indiana University</a></span><span> for three years, teaching language courses, overseeing and training tutors, and managing the tutoring program.</span>

  <span>My recent research focuses on investigating the transformative impact of emerging technologies on language learning and teaching, with particular emphasis on self-directed learning (SDL) and authentic assessment in multilingual contexts. Specifically, I categorize my CALL research into two streams: responsive and inventive CALL.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
  <span><strong>In responsive CALL</strong>, I evaluate and apply emerging technologies in language learning, contributing to the field by bridging critical gaps between technology and language pedagogy and learning strategies. One of my approaches involved studying how YouTube content creators incorporate AI tools in language education, offering insights into real-world applications of these technologies (<a class="c11" href="https://www.beeelle.com/blog/ChatGPT-and-Generative-AI-as-a-New-Partner-in-Language-Teaching-and-Learning/">Project details</a>). Additionally, I had the opportunity to contribute to the field through a systematic review of ChatGPT’s applications in language education, which aims to support future research in this rapidly evolving area.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
  <span><strong>In inventive CALL</strong>, my focus is on creating tools that address real-world needs identified through teaching. I designed and developed a mobile app, TIC APP, that created an authentic yet structured online chat environment to facilitate learners’ holistic processing of phonological visual chunks. My TIC app project is on the stage of (ADDI)”</span><span class="c22">E”</span><span>, if you possess a background in Chinese language teaching </span><span class="c22">OR</span><span> UI/UX design </span><span class="c22">OR</span><span> App development </span><span class="c22">OR</span><span> Web development </span><span class="c22">OR</span><span> quantitative research </span><span class="c22">AND</span><span> (most importantly) share an enthusiasm for contributing to this project, I am always happy to chat!</span>
