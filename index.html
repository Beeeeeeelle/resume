I am a first-year doctoral student in the Department of Learning Design and Technology at Purdue University. I research, integrate, and design instructional methods and technologies including web applications, artificial intelligence, and mixed reality for collaborative, contextual, experiential, and authentic learning experiences in blended and online learning environments. I designed and developed a mobile application, TIC APP, available for download on the App Store.

I earned my master’s degree in Instructional Systems Technology, Indiana University Bloomington, advised by Dr. Curtis J. Bonk. After graduation, I worked as the product manager at HiLink in Chicago and an Instructional & Research Manager for a year, and a visiting faculty in the Chinese flagship program at Indiana University for three years, teaching language courses, overseeing and training tutors, and managing the tutoring program. 

My current research investigates ChatGPT and Generative AI as a new partner in language teaching and learning. I approach this investigation through the perspectives of YouTubers, AI experts, and practitioners within the technology industry. Two relevant open access articles have been published in International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT) and languages. More publications are currently under review or in progress…

My TIC app project is on the stage of (ADDI)”E”, if you possess a background in Chinese language teaching OR UI/UX design OR App development OR Web development OR quantitative research AND (most importantly) share an enthusiasm for contributing to this project, I am always happy to chat!
