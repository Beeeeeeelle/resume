## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching centers on authentic, inclusive learning design. Whether I am working with doctoral students in instructional design or heritage learners of Chinese, I focus on helping learners build agency, reflect on their identities, and transfer knowledge into complex, real-world contexts. I integrate artificial intelligence, extended reality (XR), and learning analytics to scaffold self-directed learning, while grounding every course in culturally responsive pedagogy, formative assessment, and community building.

## Mentoring & Community Building

- **AI & Learning Innovation Studios.** Facilitate design charrettes for Purdue graduate students exploring GenAI for assessment, accessibility, and workforce upskilling.  
- **ConnectEd Community of Practice.** Curate open-access resource banks, moderate cross-institutional reading groups, and coach emerging scholars on IRB, grant writing, and conference proposals.  
- **Tutor Leadership Pipeline.** At Indiana University, built competency-based workshops, observation rubrics, and feedback loops that prepared tutors to become course instructors and graduate students in LDT and Applied Linguistics programs.  
- **Equity-focused teacher PD.** Co-led online institutes examining culturally and linguistically responsive professional development; findings inform the design of statewide PD ecosystems and now serve as case studies in my graduate courses.
