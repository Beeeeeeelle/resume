I have been engaged in a Chinese academic community, ConnectEd, since 2022. It aims to share research resources and findings, conduct online academic exchange lectures, and create a community for academics to connect and collaborate.

I actively participate in 

- Sharing my experience with the PhD application process.
- Serving as a teaching assistant for a Meta-Analysis Online Course for 250 Chinese students

**Teaching Philosophy**

As an instructional designer and language teacher. I'm passionate about how people today are learning, about advanced digital technology and authoring tools, as well as various cultures. My view of teaching Chinese aims not just to master the traditional “four skills” through accuracy and fluency, but to develop students' intercultural competence and critical thinking. Except for language itself, my success depends on whether my students are equipped to speak their minds with confidence and to ask critical questions about their own and other cultures.
