ðŸ“± TIC is an innovative app that provides a unique approach to learning Chinese. It was designed to address the challenges of the heavy cognitive load of retrieving and retaining Chinese characters due to their orthographic nature. TIC strengthens the semantic-phonology linkage by making "Sound-Form-Meaning" a chunk and emphasizes customization and flexibility

# Our Approach

We employed design-based research for iterative analysis, design, development, and evaluation.

# Design Motivation

As a master's student at Indiana University in 2018, I taught Chinese at the Department of East Asian Language and Culture. I noticed a student who excelled in spoken and listening skills, but due to placement exam scores, was put in a basic Chinese class. Indiana University follows ACTFL guidelines for placement, where this student was advanced in speaking and listening but novice in reading and writing.

After a few classes, the student withdrew, explaining that he aimed to read and type Chinese characters for online communication and engagement. The curriculum emphasized speaking, neglecting reading and typing. This made me realize that many American-born Chinese friends and students face similar issuesâ€”strong in spoken but weak in character recognition. They're interested in efficient Chinese typing if a suitable learning approach exists.
