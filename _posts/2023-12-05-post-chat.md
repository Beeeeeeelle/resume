**Introduction**

The reflective approach, grounded in Dewey's theories of experience, habit, and ideal, provides a grounding for the use of reflective methods in teaching (Shapiro, 2010). It has evolved to signify a deliberate process where teachers analyze their own teaching to improve their instructional methods and educational outcomes. Reflective practice is enshrined as a significant component of teacher education, for both pre-service teachers (Russell, 2018; Kaminski, 2003) and experienced teachers (Murphy, 2015). This predicated on the belief that educators must continuously engage in critical self-assessment to foster professional growth and responsiveness to the changing landscapes of learning environments.

Subsequent literature has extensively discussed its benefits, including improved critical thinking skills, heightened self-awareness, and a deeper understanding of pedagogical theories and their application in the classroom (Perels et al., 2005). Previous reviews have synthesized various strategies for implementing reflective practice, such as journals, portfolios, and collaborative discussions (Cheng and Chan, 2019). However, this publication often discusses reflective practice for higher education in general and do not fully address the cultural and institutional diversity of contemporary teacher education specifically.

This literature review examines the current challenges of implementing reflective practice in teacher education, with a particular focus on the challenges it faces for integration and implementation. Despite the recognized benefits of reflective practice for professional growth, its integration into teacher education remains fraught with difficulties. This review explores the multifaceted challenges that hinder the effective implementation of reflective practice within teacher education. The challenges discussed encompass various aspects, including fostering a culture of reflection in large group teaching settings, the lack of reflective skills among student teachers, and the assessment of reflective practice. It aims to identify gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research. The review emphasizes the need for structured support in developing reflective skills and the importance of proper guidance to prevent superficial reflection. It calls for further research on workload balance and sustained student engagement.

**Literature Review**

Reflective practice in teacher education is a critical component for the professional development of educators, yet it faces numerous challenges. McDonough (2014) highlights tensions related to obligations, loyalty, and advocacy that educators must navigate, which can complicate the reflective process. Gustavsson et al. (2019) identify key challenges in reflective practice within teacher education, including managing uncertainty, building trust, and maintaining a balance between supervising and learning. These challenges highlight the dynamic and often complex nature of fostering reflective practice among teachers. Lewis (2017) highlights practical issues, professional identity, and the perceived value of different types of professional knowledge as challenges facing teacher educators in pursuing professional development. This is echoed by Mchatton, Parker, and Vallice (2013), who suggest that critically reflective practitioners must navigate their intentions as teacher educators to overcome these challenges. The following will detail two primary challenges in large-scale teaching settings.

One of the primary challenges identified is promoting a culture of reflection in large group teaching settings, which is essential for teacher education in higher education (Clarke, 2011). Korucu and Kartal (2019) discusses the integration of reflective practices in the education of third-year EFL (English as a Foreign Language) student teachers.

In Korucu and Kartal (2019)‘s work, reflective teaching is highlighted as a critical approach in teacher education, aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of teaching practices through self-awareness, critical thinking, and problem-solving. However, they acknowledge that reflective teaching is inherently challenging, requiring a developmental process that cannot be rushed and is made more difficult by the dynamics of large classes.

One of the primary challenges identified is the lack of reflective skills among student teachers, who often come from educational backgrounds that emphasize knowledge transmission over critical self-evaluation. This lack of experience in reflective practices can lead to difficulties in objectively assessing one's own teaching and providing constructive feedback to peers. The emotional and psychological barriers, such as anxiety and the fear of offending peers, further complicate the implementation of reflective practices (Belvís et al., 2013).

Additionally, Korucu and Kartal (2019) note the logistical challenges of large classes, including time constraints and the repetitive nature of reflective tasks like journal writing and peer observation. These factors can lead to a process that feels burdensome to both students and educators.

Despite these challenges, the study found that the benefits of developing reflective practices—such as increased self-awareness and a more critical mindset—outweigh the difficulties. The student teachers reported gains in understanding new content and developing a reflective disposition, even though they also faced challenges in observing self and peers and managing the time pressure of the tasks.

The study focuses on the use of reflective procedures, such as self-monitoring, peer observation, and journal writing, in a campus-based course for EFL student teachers. The aim is to enhance the student teachers' reflective skills and improve their teaching practices. However, the development of these skills is not automatic. It requires a structured and supportive environment, which is often lacking in large class settings. The literature suggests that without proper guidance, reflective practices can become superficial and fail to lead to meaningful self-improvement.

The study found that reflective practices helped student teachers become aware of their teaching strengths and weaknesses. They were able to notice and act upon these insights, improving their teaching competencies. The article suggests that while reflective practices are beneficial for developing teaching skills, they come with challenges that need to be addressed. The repetitive nature of tasks can lead to disengagement, and there is a need for structured guidance to help student teachers reflect more effectively.

Reflective practices are a valuable component of teacher education, but they must be implemented thoughtfully to avoid burnout and ensure that student teachers can engage with the process meaningfully to improve their teaching abilities (Korucu and Kartal, 2019). However, there is a need for more research on how to effectively balance the workload and maintain student teachers' engagement with reflective tasks. The literature often acknowledges these challenges but may lack practical solutions for overcoming them. This issue is compounded by the need to integrate constructivist approaches and the concept of reflective practice in both pre-service and in-service teacher education (Spilková, 2001).

Assessing reflective practice presents another fundamental challenge in teacher education. According to Rolph and Tomlinson (1996), one of the difficulties lies in addressing the interpersonal aspects of teaching, ensuring effective facilitation, and recognizing the learning potential in classroom strategies. DeLuca et al. (2022) add that maintaining consistent learning priorities and pedagogical features that enhance reflective practice, as well as facilitating a professional stance towards learning, are also significant challenges.

Munroe et al. (2012) point out the need to align course outcomes with assessment and the importance of separating academic and non-academic outcomes. They also emphasize the coordination with students for peer feedback as a critical aspect of assessing reflective practice. Ross (2002) identifies the time and energy commitment required for reflective practice and the necessity of skilled mentors to guide novices through the developmental process.

Lys et al. (2014) provides an in-depth examination of the challenges and strategies involved in implementing the Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) within a large Teacher Preparation Program (TPP). The edTPA tasks involve planning, instruction, and assessment of student learning, all of which are activities that benefit from reflective practice. By engaging in the edTPA, teacher candidates are encouraged to reflect on their teaching practices, assess their effectiveness, and make informed decisions to improve their instruction. This reflective process is integral to the professional growth and development of teachers, ensuring that they are not only prepared to teach but also equipped to continue learning and improving throughout their careers.

Lys et al. (2014) discusses the challenges faced by TPPs when implementing reflective practices, specifically through the adoption of the edTPA. One of the primary challenges is the development of an appropriate organizational structure and support model to facilitate large-scale implementation. This includes ensuring that both the program and faculty are ready to embrace and integrate new reflective practices into their curriculum.

Faculty readiness is a significant hurdle, with micro-political issues within the institution posing barriers to change. Faculty members may be deeply invested in existing practices, making them resistant to adopting new methods like the edTPA. Moreover, the faculty's readiness is not just about capacity but also about their disposition towards change, which can be influenced by their experiences with past educational reforms and their perceptions of the new assessment's validity and reliability.

Lys et al. (2014) highlights the complexities involved in integrating reflective practice into teacher education, particularly through the lens of implementing the edTPA. A significant challenge is establishing a robust organizational structure that can support the reflective practice at scale. This involves ensuring that both faculty and programs are adequately prepared for the transition, which can be hindered by resistance to change due to entrenched practices and micro-political dynamics within educational institutions.

Faculty training emerges as a critical need, with the document underscoring the importance of equipping educators with the skills to engage in and facilitate reflective practice effectively. This is particularly relevant in the context of curriculum mapping, which requires a backward design approach to ensure that teacher candidates are well-prepared for reflective assessments like the edTPA.

Technological support is also a noted challenge, as the implementation of edTPA requires both faculty and students to navigate new digital platforms and tools. The process is described as iterative, necessitating ongoing refinement, discussion, and adaptation to ensure that reflective practices are meaningfully integrated into teacher education and lead to genuine improvement.

Lastly, the Lys et al. (2014) touched on the dispositional readiness of faculty, which involves fostering a mindset open to change and innovation. Concerns about the validity and reliability of new assessments compared to traditional methods are also mentioned, indicating a need for clear communication and demonstration of the benefits of reflective practice to gain broader acceptance within TPPs.

Lys et al.'s article is an informative case study on the large-scale implementation of the edTPA, offering valuable lessons for TPPs undergoing similar transitions. While it effectively outlines the process and immediate benefits of the edTPA, further research is needed to critically assess the long-term implications of standardized performance assessments on the teaching profession.

Reflective practice in teacher education, as grounded in the theories of Dewey and further expounded upon by scholars like Shapiro (2010), Russell (2018), and Kaminski (2003), is an essential process for the professional development of educators. It fosters critical self-assessment, professional growth, and responsiveness to the evolving landscapes of learning environments. Despite its recognized benefits, such as improved critical thinking, heightened self-awareness, and a deeper understanding of pedagogical theories, the integration and implementation of reflective practice within teacher education face significant challenges.

**Conclusion**

The literature reviewed, including the works of McDonough (2014), Gustavsson et al. (2019), and Lewis (2017), highlights the multifaceted nature of these challenges. They range from the logistical struggles within large class settings, as noted by Clarke (2011) and Korucu and Kartal (2019), to the nuanced difficulties in fostering an environment conducive to reflection. The lack of reflective skills among student teachers, the emotional and psychological barriers to self and peer assessment, and the logistical challenges of managing large classes are all barriers to effective reflective practice.

Moreover, the assessment of reflective practice, as discussed by Rolph and Tomlinson (1996) and Munroe et al. (2012), presents its own set of challenges, including the alignment of course outcomes with assessment and the need for skilled mentors. The implementation of standardized performance assessments, such as the edTPA discussed by Lys et al. (2014), while beneficial, requires a robust organizational structure, faculty readiness, and technological support, all of which can be substantial hurdles.

This review has identified several gaps in the research that warrant further examination. First, there is a need for more empirical studies on the long-term effects of reflective practice on teaching competencies and educational outcomes. Second, research is needed to explore effective strategies for overcoming the emotional and psychological barriers to reflective practice. Third, the impact of technological advancements on reflective practice, particularly in large-scale settings, remains an underexplored area. Finally, the micro-political dynamics within educational institutions and their influence on the adoption of reflective practices need further investigation.
