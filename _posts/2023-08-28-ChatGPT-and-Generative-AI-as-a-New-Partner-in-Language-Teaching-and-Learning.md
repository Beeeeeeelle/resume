**∗Li, B**., Lowell, V., Watson, & Wang, C. (2024). A systematic review of the first year of publications on ChatGPT and language education: Examining research on ChatGPT’s use in language learning and teaching. *Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence*, 100, 100266. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100266](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100266) 

- Abstract
    
    > This systematic review aims to explore published research on the use of ChatGPT in language learning between November 2022 and November 2023, outlining the types of papers, methodologies adopted, publishing journals, major research trends, topics of interest, and existing gaps demanding attention. The PRISMA framework was utilized to capture the latest published articles, selecting 36 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Findings extracted from this review include (1) authors worldwide contribute to this topic, with Asia and North America leading; (2) the wide distribution across various journals underscores the interdisciplinary nature of this research topic, such as computer science, psychology, linguistics, education, and other social sciences; (3) empirical research dominates the literature that is published, with the majority focusing on higher education and ethical considerations. Other findings include that ChatGPT plays multifaceted roles, supporting self-directed language learning, content generation, and teacher workflows. Research gaps include the need for diversified scopes, longitudinal studies, exploration of stakeholders’ perceptions, and assessments of feedback quality.

- Abstract
    
    > This exploratory analysis investigates the integration of ChatGPT in self-directed learning (SDL). Specifically, this study examines YouTube content creators’ language-learning experiences and the role of ChatGPT in their SDL, building upon Song and Hill's conceptual model of SDL in online contexts. Thematic analysis of interviews with 19 YouTubers and relevant video contents reveals distinct constructs of ChatGPT-integrated SDL, suggesting a reconceptualization and refinement of the SDL framework in the consideration of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This framework emphasizes critical aspects of utilizing ChatGPT as an SDL tool on two distinct levels: 1) the interactive relationships and interplay between learners’ personal traits and their ongoing learning processes (local) and 2) the evolving nature of SDL in the rapidly advancing landscape of generative AI, with socio-political-cultural foundations of AI constantly shaping the learning environment where SDL occurs (global). The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT as a tool for promoting self-directed language learning (SDLL) and provides implications for the development of learning technologies and research on AI-facilitated SDL.

- Abstract
    
    > This study explores the integration of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in self-directed language learning (SDLL) as perceived by YouTube content creators. Through thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 14 prominent online language educators with related YouTube videos on ChatGPT, the present study investigates: (1) their perceptions of GenAI as a tool for SDLL, (2) strategies that they recommend to effectively utilize ChatGPT for enhancing SDLL, and (3) the guidelines they suggest for fostering SDLL with AI. The findings show that YouTube-based language educators acknowledged ChatGPT as a vital tool for SDLL as it offers availability, versatility, and transformative potential. Besides linguistic benefits, ChatGPT enhances SDLL experiences by generating contextually relevant responses and fostering meaningful conversations and learner growth. The study highlights the importance of addressing ethical, pedagogical, and sociocultural factors when incorporating AI in SDL and educators’ critical role in facilitating learners’ navigation through the evolving landscape of SDL in the age of generative AI. The study contributes to refining online language learning models and comprehending the impact of generative AI on SDL.

- Abstract
    
    > Since late 2022, dozens of YouTube channels focusing on a diverse array of topics related to language learning with generative AI tools such as ChatGPT have rapidly emerged. This study explores the implementations and perspectives of YouTube content creators who now constitute an increasingly important segment of the ecosystem of language teaching and learning. A mixed methods netnographic approach was employed, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. A total of 140 videos were identified and analyzed, and an in-depth content analysis was conducted to uncover underlying themes. Four main categories of creators were identified: educators, learners, technology professionals, and e-learning providers. Educators, especially English and Japanese teachers, were the majority, followed by learners and technology field professionals. This study highlights the benefits, drawbacks, and concerns associated with the integration of AI tools in language learning. By examining this rapidly evolving phenomenon, the study contributes towards an understanding of the role and impact of generative AI tools in language education.

- Abstract
    
    > ChatGPT's ability to realistically mimic human conversation and its high level of ability to handle linguistic ambiguity opens new and exciting avenues in language learning. Building upon the technical affordances of ChatGPT, this study explores the perceptions of educational affordances when incorporating ChatGPT across languages discussed by language communities on YouTube and identifies best practices for its effective use in language education. Through inductive content analysis, this study discussed 18 languages categorized into four groups: (1) romanized languages with high resources, (2) non-romanized languages with high resources, (3) languages with medium resources, and (4) less frequently used languages. The findings reveal consensus that (a) ChatGPT is a valuable and remarkable tool for language teaching and, (b) learning and it cannot fully replace teachers, as humor, wit, and sympathy cannot be programmed. Two potentially significant issues or two gaps were identified and discussed: namely, the learning optimization gap and the knowledge comprehension gap.
