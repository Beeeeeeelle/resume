> Since late 2022, dozens of YouTube channels focusing on a diverse array of topics related to language learning with generative AI tools such as ChatGPT have rapidly emerged. This study explores the implementations and perspectives of YouTube content creators who now constitute an increasingly important segment of the ecosystem of language teaching and learning. A mixed methods netnographic approach was employed, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. A total of 140 videos were identified and analyzed, and an in-depth content analysis was conducted to uncover underlying themes. Four main categories of creators were identified: educators, learners, technology professionals, and e-learning providers. Educators, especially English and Japanese teachers, were the majority, followed by learners and technology field professionals. This study highlights the benefits, drawbacks, and concerns associated with the integration of AI tools in language learning. By examining this rapidly evolving phenomenon, the study contributes towards an understanding of the role and impact of generative AI tools in language education.

> ChatGPT's ability to realistically mimic human conversation and its high level of ability to handle linguistic ambiguity opens new and exciting avenues in language learning. Building upon the technical affordances of ChatGPT, this study explores the perceptions of educational affordances when incorporating ChatGPT across languages discussed by language communities on YouTube and identifies best practices for its effective use in language education. Through inductive content analysis, this study discussed 18 languages categorized into four groups: (1) romanized languages with high resources, (2) non-romanized languages with high resources, (3) languages with medium resources, and (4) less frequently used languages. The findings reveal consensus that (a) ChatGPT is a valuable and remarkable tool for language teaching and, (b) learning and it cannot fully replace teachers, as humor, wit, and sympathy cannot be programmed. Two potentially significant issues or two gaps were identified and discussed: namely, the learning optimization gap and the knowledge comprehension gap.
